# URage Pulse - SFX Generator

A powerful Web Audio API-based sound effects generator that allows you to create custom audio samples with various waveforms, parameters, and presets.

## Features

- **Multiple Waveform Types**: Square, Sawtooth, Sine, and Triangle waveforms
- **Preset System**: Predefined sound effects for quick use (Jump, Explosion, Blip, Laser, Powerup, Shoot, Hit, Bounce)
- **Real-time Visualization**: Audio waveform visualization during playback
- **Parameter Controls**: 
  - Frequency (Freq)
  - Duration (Length)
  - Slide (frequency slide effect)
  - ADSR Envelope (Attack, Decay)
- **Save & Load Presets**: Store your custom sound effects for later use
- **Randomize Function**: Generate random sound effects with one click
- **Download WAV Files**: Export your creations as WAV audio files

## How It Works

This tool uses the Web Audio API to generate sound effects in real-time. You can adjust various parameters to create different sounds:

1. **Waveform Selection**: Choose between different waveform types that affect the sound character
2. **Frequency Control**: Adjust the base frequency of the sound
3. **Duration**: Control how long the sound lasts
4. **Slide**: Create pitch slide effects by adjusting the frequency over time
5. **ADSR Envelope**: Control the attack and decay of the sound for more natural sound shaping

## Usage Instructions

1. **Select a Preset**: Click on any preset button (Jump, Explosion, Blip, etc.) to load a predefined sound effect
2. **Adjust Parameters**: Use the sliders to modify the sound characteristics:
   - **Freq**: Base frequency of the sound
   - **Length**: Duration of the sound effect
   - **Slide**: Pitch slide effect (positive values increase pitch, negative values decrease pitch)
   - **Attack/Decay**: Control the envelope of the sound
3. **Waveform Selection**: Choose between Square, Sawtooth, Sine, and Triangle waveforms
4. **Play Sound**: Click the "🔊 PLAY" button to hear your sound effect
5. **Download**: Click the "💾 WAV" button to download your sound effect as a WAV file
6. **Save Preset**: Click "💾 Save Preset" to save your current settings for later use

## Controls

- **Waveform Buttons**: Select different waveform types
- **Lock Buttons**: Lock parameters to prevent accidental changes
- **Randomize Button**: Generate random sound effect parameters
- **Preset Buttons**: Load predefined sound effects
- **Play Button**: Play the current sound effect
- **Download Button**: Save the sound effect as a WAV file
- **Save Preset Button**: Save current settings as a custom preset
- **Load Preset Button**: Load previously saved presets

## Technical Details

This tool uses the Web Audio API for sound generation and the Canvas API for real-time waveform visualization. All processing happens in the browser - no external dependencies or server requests required.
