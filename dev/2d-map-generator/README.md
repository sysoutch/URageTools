# 2D Map Generator

A browser-based procedural 2D map generation sandbox focused on fast experimentation, stylized level blockouts, and game-ready layout prototyping.

Generate pixel-art worlds across multiple 2D perspectives including topdown, angled 3/4 RPG view, isometric, tactical, and side-scroller layouts with live previews, procedural rules, sprite systems, seeded generation, animated assets, and export tooling.

The default sprite library is catalog-driven. Built-in map sprites, hidden image assets, player variants, and per-mode player counts are declared in `index.html` and consumed dynamically by the generator, so the tool no longer depends on hardcoded built-in ids in rendering or placement code.

Designed for indie developers, pixel artists, tool builders, game jam teams, and rapid gameplay iteration.
