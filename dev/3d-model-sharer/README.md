# 3D Model Sharer

Single-file static web tool for previewing and uploading 3D models.

No npm.  
No Vite.  
No backend server.  
No OAuth server.  
No build step.

Open:

```text
index.html
```

## Fix in this build

The previous build sent:

```text
license=cc-by
```

Sketchfab rejects that.

The valid Sketchfab license choices are:

```text
by
by-sa
by-nd
by-nc
by-nc-sa
by-nc-nd
cc0
st
ed
qx
free-st
```

The tool now sends the exact slug selected in the Download dropdown.

## Download behavior

Sketchfab’s upload API does not use a simple `download=Free` field.

Downloadability is controlled by setting a valid `license`.

The tool maps:

- No downloads → no `license` field is sent
- Free download → sends the chosen license slug, for example `by`
- Store → not sent, because store listing is not available through the public upload API

## Website-only toggles

The following toggles are visible on Sketchfab’s website UI, but are not documented writable upload API fields:

- Allow comments
- Promotional content
- Created with generative AI tools

So the tool no longer sends fake fields for them.

### Is there really no way?

Not through the documented public upload API.

Possible alternatives:

1. Change those settings manually on Sketchfab after upload.
2. Use tags where appropriate, for example `CreatedWithAI` or `NoAI`, but that is not the same as the website toggle.
3. Ask Sketchfab/Fab support for partner/private API access if your app needs those fields officially.

## Supported upload fields kept in the tool

- name
- description
- tags
- categories
- private visibility
- isPublished
- isInspectable
- isAgeRestricted
- license

## Private models

Private/password-protected models require Sketchfab Pro.

## FBX texture patch

For packed FBX files where embedded texture references end in `.fbm`, the tool patches the FBX before preview and upload so texture importers see `.png`, `.jpg`, `.tga`, or `.bmp` instead of `.fbm`.


## Fix in this build

The previous build unintentionally enabled:

```text
isInspectable=1
```

whenever a downloadable license was selected.

This build fixes that.

Now:
- Download license selection only sets the license
- Texture inspection is controlled only by the actual toggle
- If the toggle is OFF, the upload sends:

```text
isInspectable=0
```


## AI-created model reminder

Sketchfab’s **Created with generative AI tools** website toggle is not exposed as a documented public upload API field.

This build adds:

- an in-tool warning
- a checkbox: “This model used generative AI tools”
- post-upload links:
  - View uploaded model
  - Open model properties

After upload, click **Open model properties** and enable the AI disclosure manually if applicable.

Example properties URL format:

```text
https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/<MODEL_UID>/properties
```


## Auto-open properties page

If the checkbox:

```text
This model used AI (Open Model Properties after Upload)
```

is enabled, the tool automatically opens the uploaded model's Sketchfab properties page after upload so the user can quickly enable the website-only AI disclosure toggle.


## License selector update

The Download UI now shows only:

- No
- Free
- Store

When **Free** is selected, a **Change License** button appears.

The default free license is:

```text
CC Attribution
```

which uploads as:

```text
license=by
```

The license modal supports:

- Free Standard
- CC Attribution
- Non Commercial
- No derivatives
- Share alike

The generated Sketchfab license slugs are:

```text
by
by-sa
by-nd
by-nc
by-nc-sa
by-nc-nd
free-st
```

Store remains an informational option because the public upload API does not expose Store/Fab listing setup.
