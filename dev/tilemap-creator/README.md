# Core Features

## Multi-Tileset Workflow

Load and work with multiple tilesets simultaneously.

Features:

* Multiple active tilesets.
* Fast tileset switching.
* Multi-image upload as separate tilesets or one combined tileset.
* Floating tileset browser.
* Floating layer manager with layer selection, visibility, erase, reorder, and opacity controls.
* Floating layer rows are rendered through `js/layerPanel.js`, keeping row controls and action binding out of the main editor script.
* Paint source selection is backed by `js/paintOptions.js`, keeping random and ordered tile-pool picking separate from the canvas paint loop.
* Hover tile previews.
* Tab and Shift+Tab switching.
* Ctrl-click or Ctrl-drag additive tile selection inside the active tileset.
* Combined global tile indexing.
* Runtime tileset management.
* Paint source modes now read both rectangular brush selections and additive flat tile pools correctly.
* Grid projection can switch between the current orthogonal canvas and an isometric diamond canvas for fitting transparent isometric sprites.

Ideal for:

* Large RPG worlds.
* Multi-biome environments.
* Layered environments.
* Complex tile pipelines.

# Advanced Painting System

A flexible painting workflow designed for both precision editing and rapid level construction.

## Brush Modes

Supported tools:

* Paint.
* Erase.
* Fill.
* Rectangle.
* Rectangle outline.
* Circle.
* Single-tile.
* Move.
* Pick.
* Full-tileset brushes.

Features:

* Click painting.
* Drag painting.
* Paint Options source modes: Stamp, Random, Forward, Reverse, Ping-pong, and Cell noise.
* Non-stamp source modes now override smart-wall stamping for normal paint/fill strokes instead of collapsing back to the first selected tile.
* Ordered paint-source modes now only advance after the cursor enters a different map cell, so lingering on one tile does not keep stepping the sequence.
* Straight-line painting.
* Rectangle erasing.
* Brush flipping.
* Brush mirroring.
* Selection transforms.
* Tile movement.
* Embedded tileset project export and reload.

---

## Smart Wall Brush System

A procedural auto-wall painting workflow for creating connected environments quickly.

Supports:

* Starts.
* Middles.
* Corners.
* T-junctions.
* Intersections.
* Edge transitions.

Features:

* Visual assignment cards.
* Connection preview icons.
* Tile previews.
* Auto role mapping.
* Auto role mapping now preserves preview cards when the source brush is a multi-tile or cropped nested selection.
* Auto role mapping now commits through the same per-role assignment path as manual role edits, so mapped roles stay usable for previews and connected painting.
* Auto role mapping treats the largest selected island as the main wall block, feeds any additional detached full 2x2 islands into inner corners, and can also peel any valid inline 2x2 block out of one connected selection footprint when the inner-corner sprites are packed right next to the main brush.
* Per-profile Smart Wall inner-corner source X/Y toggles only affect how the selected 2x2 inner-corner block is assigned during auto-map, letting you choose whether the first source tile maps to top-left or to the mirrored opposite direction without changing normal wall-role picking.
* Rect-outline smart-wall painting now evaluates role masks against the full rectangle footprint, so perimeter strokes use terrain edge/corner roles instead of collapsing to line-only roles.
* Runtime smart brush editing.
* Connected tile placement.

Ideal for:

* Dungeon generation.
* RPG interiors.
* Cave systems.
* Terrain walls.
* Connected structures.

---

# Mirroring & Symmetry

Speed up environment construction using live map mirroring.

Supported modes:

* Map Mirror X.
* Map Mirror Y.
* Brush Mirror X.
* Brush Mirror Y.
* Selection flipping.
* Horizontal transforms.
* Vertical transforms.

Ideal for:

* Arena maps.
* Symmetrical layouts.
* Puzzle maps.

* Fast environmental iteration.

---

# Selection & Editing Tools

Advanced selection tooling for large-scale editing.

Features:

* Full-map selection.

# Canvas Navigation

A smooth editor-style navigation system designed for large maps.

Features:

* Middle-mouse panning.
* Shift-drag panning.
* Mouse-wheel zoom.
* Viewport fitting.
* Floating helper panels.
* Responsive dashboard layout.
* Fast large-map navigation.
* Isometric projection mode keeps painting, hover previews, selection overlays, and PNG export aligned to the diamond grid.

---

A polished browser-based dashboard interface designed for real production workflows.

Features:

* Floating helper panels.
* Collapsible sidebar sections.
* Remembered UI state.
* Dashboard media tray support.

# Export Format

```json
{
  "tileSize": 32,
  "gridMode": "orthogonal",
  "width": 30,
  "height": 20,
  "layers": [
    [
      [0, 1, -1, 2],
      [1, 0, 0, -1]
    ]
  ],
  "tilesets": [
    {
      "name": "terrain.png",
      "columns": 8,
      "rows": 8,
      "tileCount": 64,
      "firstTile": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

`-1` represents an empty tile.

Tile indexes are global across all loaded tilesets.

The first loaded tileset starts at `0`, and additional tilesets continue indexing after the previous tileset's tile count.
